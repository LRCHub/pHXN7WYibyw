All I wanted to do was to fly out of there
Now all I wanna do is drive on back
All I wanted to do was to fly out of there
Now all I wanna do is drive on back
I might as well grown wings
When I turned 18
Those no-name streets felt like concrete
Walls that were keepin' me in
But before you even know it
The wheels get to rollin'
And there ain't mo slowin' 'em down
Now all I wanna do
Yeah, all I wanna do
Is turn around and drive on
Drive on back
Back to where i came from
Back to that place
Where I was raised up
To that barrack, that church
That made me, that saved me
Drive on back
Back to them good old days
Where nothing's ever gonna change
Them good old ways
And now and then
When the world gets to drivin' me crazy
I drive on back
(Come on!)
It might feel good to leave
But it feels even better
Comin' 'cross county lines
Seein' hometown letters
Sayin', "Welcome home"
It's been to long
And there ain't no place like this
Where the speed limit sign reads 35
It ain't just a law, no, its a way of life
When the world moves
A little to fast
I get on that gas and drive on
Drive on back
Back to where i came from
Back to that place
Where I was raised up
To that barrack, that church
That made me, that saved me
Drive on back
Back to them good old days
Where nothing's ever gonna change
Them good old ways
And now and then
When the world gets to drivin' me crazy
I drive on back
All I wanted to do was to fly out of there
Now all I wanna do is drive on back
All I wanted to do was to fly out of there
Now all I wanna do is drive on back
(Drive)
Drive on back
Back to where I came from
Back to that place
Where I was raised up
To that barrack, that church
That made me, that saved me
Drive on back
Back to them good old days
Where nothing's ever gonna change
Them good old ways
And now and then
When the world gets to drivin' me crazy
I drive on back
I can't hide it
I can't hide it
Drive on back
I can't hide it
I drive on
